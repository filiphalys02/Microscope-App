# Microscope-App
Application made in Java FX as a final project for the course "Object-oriented programming in Java". The application was written in the Kate environment on the Slackware operating system (Linux). The application is used to view the image from a simple microscope connected to a computer via a USB cable. The user can save the current image frame to any location on the device.
To enable the application, it is necessary to run the "s" file in the console:
cd ./<path to the project>
chmod u+x s
./s
After starting the process, user can compile and run App (in Kate: <comp_FX javaFXApp.java> <run_FX JavaFXpp>)
